## Overview
This project is about building an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

### Tools:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript 

### Setup

To get the project up and running follow the steps below:

1. To set up project environment, make sure that the Node and packages (express, cors and body-parser) installed, and which are used to create the server.

2. After that to start your server, run the command `node server.js` in your terminal

### Development Strategy

* Setting up project environment, making sure Node and packages installed, and included in server.js file.
* Added POST and GET routes to ensure correct retrieval of data from the server.
* Acquired API credentials from OpenWeatherMap website.
* Created async functions to fetch weather data and store it on my local server.
* Set up a function that updated UI dynamically.

## Extras
If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.
